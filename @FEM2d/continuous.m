function [CI,CB] = continuous(M)
%CONTINUOUS Basis for space of continuous functions
%   [CI,CB] = continuous(M)
%
%   Output:
%   CI     An (6n√ók) matrix whose columns form a basis for the continuous
%          piecewise quadratic functions with homogeneous Dirichlet
%          conditions. This is determined by looking for vertices 
%          [X(i,j),Y(i,j)] that are repeated. Note that if
%          roundoff is present in the values of X and Y, then C might
%          break. One way to ensure that no roundoff is present in X and Y
%          is to start with integer coordinates before one applies
%          subdivision.
%   CB     Basis vectors for boundary values.
